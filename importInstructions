These are just my recommendations:

Instructions for anyone having trouble setting up the project:
1. Nuke any failed attempts on your local machine.
2. Get the clone url from github.
3. (Tested using GitBash) git clone to anywhere on your local machine.
4. Import into Android Studio: File -> New -> Import Project
5. The Android Studio project is inside the local clone of the github project

Version Control
1. Don't bother with Android Studio's version control
2. Use GitBash (from inside the repo folder, not the android studio project folder) for pulls, commits, and pushes
